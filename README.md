On this webpage I used <br>
JavaScript <br>
JQuery<br>
HTML <br>
CSS<br>

The JavaScript in this project handles the product information. The store options and prices are arrays in Javascript that are created when the printList() is called in HTML. <br>

JQuery was used to dynamically add items purchased to the shopping cart using the append method. I also utilized the click method to listen for <br>
clicks on the add to shopping cart button. Finally the text method was called to update the shopping cart with the new cart total. <br>

The HTML needed in this project was very minimal. The "bones" of the webpage are laid out and most of the content is loaded through the linked JavaScript file.

Finally the CSS re-organizes the placement of values for a more visually appealing online store.
